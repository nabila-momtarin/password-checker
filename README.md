# Password Checker
A simple C# console application that allows users to securely enter and confirm their password. It checks if the entered password matches the confirmation and provides feedback if they don't match or if any field is left empty.

## Features
- **Password Validation**: Ensures that the user does not leave the password or confirmation blank.
- **Password Matching**: Prompts the user to confirm the password and ensures both passwords match.

2. Open the project in a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Run the application. The console will prompt you to enter a password and confirm it.
4. If the passwords match, you will see a success message. If they donâ€™t match, you will be prompted to try again.
